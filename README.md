Find out what ip address is being handed out to torrent trackers.

ipmag allows you to quickly check what adresses your BitTorrent client
is handing out to its Trackers. It does this by generating a magnet link,
which when being requested generates a database entry.

The interface can be used without having JavaScript enabled.

Requirements
	A Server accessible on the internet, providing
	- an HTTP daemon (eg. lighttpd)
	- with PHP5 (eg. php5-cgi (debian)) optionally with enabled JSON 
	  extensions for use by the AJAX interface (mostly the default by now)
	- SQLite PDO modules for PHP5 (eg. php5-sqlite (debian))
	- The user running the HTTP daemon (www-data on debian) must have
	  read/write access on the database file as well as the folder 
	  containing it
	- The short_open_tag option should be set to "off" in php.ini

Setup
	Clone the repo into a folder that is available by the httpd.
	Edit index.php
		Change the tracker URL (line 2) to point to the public
		 location of the index.php file.
	
		Optionally edit the database path (line 3) if you do not
		 want to have the database in the same folder for security
		 reasons (or set up your webserver so it denies access to
		 the database file).

	If you'd like to set a timeout after which clients should recheck their
	IP against the tracking link, set $enableInterval to true on line 4.
	WARNING: This feature may be ignored or may break some clients
	(and they'd be right) as the spec explicitly states that when a
	'failure reason' key is sent (which ipMagnet does), NO other key
	may be present. So use at your own risk.

	Large or high-volume installations, much as I would encourage everyone
	to host their own instances instead, should probably use some advanced 
	safeguards, such as using a RDBMS more suited for such workloads (such 
	as PostgreSQL or MariaDB) as the data backend. This can be done by 
	changing the DSN (Data Source Name). Please refer to the PHP PDO manual 
	for information on how to do that.
	The database needs to contain a table named 'hits' with the columns
		'id' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL UNIQUE
		'hash' TEXT NOT NULL or VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL 
				(depending on your RDBMS)
		'timestamp' INTEGER NOT NULL
		'addr' TEXT NOT NULL or VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
		'agent' TEXT NOT NULL or VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
	Another good idea would be to use a cronjob to regularly wipe the 
	database to ensure better privacy on behalf of the users.

	Example configuration snippet for Apache
		<Files "ipmagnet.db3">
			Order allow,deny
			Deny from all
		</Files>
